# Distributed-Hash-Table
A simple DHT based on the [Chord] (https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/papers/chord:sigcomm01/chord_sigcomm.pdf) algorithm. The model implements
simplified version of the Chord and supports:
1. ID space partitioning/re-partioning
2. Ring based routing
3. Node joins

To test the messenger application, use the groupmessenger1-grading.osx. Before executing it, do the following:

1. Use create_avd.py to create AVDs
2. Run run_avd.py to run them
3. Use set_redir.py to setup the testing environment.

More can be found in the specification document.
